abstract: 'Behavioral medicine is devoting increasing attention to the topic of participant engagement and its role in effective mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions. Several definitions of the term "engagement" have been proposed and discussed, especially in the context of digital health behavioral interventions. We consider that engagement refers to specific interaction and use patterns with the mHealth tools such as smartphone applications for intervention, whereas adherence refers to compliance with the directives of the health intervention, independent of the mHealth tools. Through our analysis of participant interaction and self-reported behavioral data in a college student health study with incentives, we demonstrate an example of measuring "effective engagement" as engagement behaviors that can be linked to the goals of the desired intervention. We demonstrate how clustering of one year of weekly health behavior self-reports generate four interpretable clusters related to participantsâ€™ adherence to the desired health behaviors: healthy and steady, unhealthy and steady, decliners, and improvers. Based on the intervention goals of this study (health promotion and behavioral change), we show that not all app usage metrics are indicative of the desired outcomes that create effective engagement. As such, mHealth intervention design might consider eliciting not just more engagement or use overall, but rather, effective engagement defined by use patterns related to the desired behavioral outcome.'
