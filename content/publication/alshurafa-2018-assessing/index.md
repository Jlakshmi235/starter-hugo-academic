abstract: 'Melanoma survivors often do not engage in adequate sun protection, leading to sunburn and increasing their risk of future melanomas. Melanoma survivors do not accurately recall the extent of sun exposure they have received, thus, they may be unaware of their personal UV exposure, and this lack of awareness may contribute towards failure to change behavior. As a means of determining behavioral accuracy of recall of sun exposure, this study compared subjective self-reports of time outdoors to an objective wearable sensor. Analysis of the meaningful discrepancies between the self-report and sensor measures of time out- doors was made possible by using a network flow algorithm to align sun exposure events recorded by both measures. Aligning the two measures provides the opportunity to more accurately evaluate false positive and false negative self-reports of behavior and under- stand participant tendencies to over- and under-report behavior. 39 melanoma survivors wore an ultraviolet light (UV) sensor on their chest while outdoors for 10 consecutive summer days and provided an end-of-day subjective self-report of their behavior while outdoors. A Network Flow Alignment framework was used to align self-report and objective UV sensor data to correct misalignment. The frequency and time of day of under- and over-reporting were identified.'
